# Equitable AI for Dermatology

## Project Overview
AI is transforming healthcare, yet dermatology AI tools often underperform for people with darker skin tones due to a lack of diverse training data. This can lead to diagnostic errors, delayed treatments, and health disparities for underserved communities.

This challenge from Break Through Tech and the Algorithmic Justice League invites students to help address this issue by building an inclusive machine learning model for dermatology.
